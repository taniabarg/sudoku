# sudoku
Two-player Sudoku-esque game coded in Python.

- After entering a grid size, make a move in this format: row, column, value (note that indexing starts at 0).
- Take turns with another player. The first player to run out of moves loses. If the grid fills up, there is a tie.
- At any time in the game, enter "s" to save the game to a text file to continue later, "l" to load a game from a text            file, and "q" to quit.
